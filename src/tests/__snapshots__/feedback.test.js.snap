        "Yulia is an incredibly talented, hard-working individual. I would recommend her to work in any area she pursues. She volunteered under me and also worked for a school I was on the board for. In both circumstances, paid and unpaid, she was dedicated, faithful, consistent, honest, kind, loving, full of good ideas, took initiative, and easy to work with."
